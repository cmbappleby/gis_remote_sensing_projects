# GIS and Remote Sensing Projects
Projects from classes at Idaho State Univeristy and University of Rhode Island, as well as a StoryMap.

## Highlighted Projects
The following projects respectively highlight:
* Coding and documentation skills for GIS analysis
* Proficieny in deep learning and model implemention
* Experience working with radar datasets
* Processing LiDAR data

Projects with an asterisk (*) are research papers for final projects and also showcase my writing skills.

### [Post-Fire Vegetation Regrowth Analysis](https://github.com/cmbappleby/gis_remote_sensing_projects/blob/main/post_fire_veg_regrowth_analysis.pdf)*
Performed a linear regression analysis using pre- and post-fire NDVI data to assess the impact of slope, aspect, and burn severity on post-fire vegetation regrowth at the Cold Fire burn scar in California. Used free and open-source software (FOSS), including various Python packages, Jupyter Notebook, QGIS, and earth observation data to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of FOSS.

### [Jackrabbit Detection in Thermal Video](https://github.com/cmbappleby/gis_remote_sensing_projects/blob/main/YOLOv5_thermal_jackrabbit_detection.pdf)*
Evaluated the effectiveness of the YOLOv5 machine learning model for detecting jackrabbits in thermal imagery obtained using a sUAS.

### [Uintah Basin Interferometric Synthetic Aperature Radar (InSAR) Analysis](https://github.com/cmbappleby/gis_remote_sensing_projects/blob/main/uintah_basin_InSAR_SBAS.pdf)*
Using Sentinel-1 radar imagery, performed Differential InSAR and Small Baseline Subset InSAR to detect land subsidence of the Natural Buttes gas field in Northeaster Utah using the European Space Agency SNAP software and the Alaska Satellite Facility OpenScienceLab.

### [Big Crater Ring LiDAR Processing](https://github.com/cmbappleby/gis_remote_sensing_projects/blob/main/LiDAR_crater_rings.pdf)
Processed raw LiDAR data, including strip alignment, spatial indexing, and point cloud alignment with a photogrammetry point cloud. Used these point clouds to classify the points and create various products such as a digital elevation model, canopy height map, and orthomosaic.
